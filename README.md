## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use SQL to perform data analysis on a sample retail dataset. It covers data extraction, aggregation, joining, and optimization techniques.

## 🗂 Dataset
The project uses four tables:
- *customers* – customer details
- *orders (1)* – order transactions
- *products* – product details
- *order_items* – items in each order

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- MySQL (or PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- SQL queries

## 📝 What I Did
- Imported sample dataset into MySQL
- Wrote SQL queries covering:
  - SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
  - GROUP BY with SUM & AVG
  - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT JOINs
  - Subqueries for advanced analysis
  - Created `VIEW`s for reusable queries
  - Added `INDEX`es for performance optimization

## 🖥 How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Import the CSVs into your SQL database  
3. Run the .sql file included in this repo  
4. View outputs (take screenshots or export to CSV)

## 📊 Example Outputs
- Customer spending summary
- Orders above a certain amount
- Products priced higher than the average

## 📝 Deliverables
- .sql file containing all queries
- Screenshots of query outputs
- README file describing the project
